                    <p>I am a keen and energised physicist currently completing my PhD at the

                    Birmingham</a>.</p>

                        <li>the general behaviour of linear quantum systems,</li>
                        <li>applications of quantum systems to high-precision
                        measurements, especially quantum noise,</li>
                        <li>designing detectors for new physics.</li>

            <h3>general realisation techniques for high-precision measurements</h3>
            <p>Recently I have been working to bring techniques developed by the
            quantum control community into the realm of high-precision
            measurements. Specifically a way to realise arbitrary linear quantum
            systems from their transfer functions.
            A paper I have written utilising this is currently at the final
            draft stage.</p>

            <p>In the future I plan to apply these techniques to the realisation
            of second-order quantum filters for use in gravitational-wave detectors.</p>

            <p>I am also currently writing a python module to automatically
            find the realisation from a given transfer function called <a
            href="https://github.com/joebentley/simba" target="_blank">SImBA</a>.</p>

            <h3>design of next-generation gravitational wave
            interferometers</h3>
            <p>I am also interested in how the quantum noise of next-generation
            gravitational wave detectors can be improved, for example using
            novel quantum devices such as the <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00117" target="_blank">unstable
            filter</a> in novel new configurations as I did in publication 1 <a
            href="#ref1">below</a>.</p>

            <h3>control issues in unstable quantum systems</h3>
            <p>I am also interested in studying the control of unstable quantum systems, such as
            the unstable filter, and whether or not a stabilising controller can be
            achieved in cases where approximations break down, such as long cavities.</p>

            I have significant experience in Python, C++, Mathematica,
            HTML/CSS/JavaScript (I designed this website by hand). I also have
            good knowledge of C, Go, Rust, and Haskell.
